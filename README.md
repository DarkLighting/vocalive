This tool creates a dictionary using the words found at the specified web address. Let's say you wanted to make a list of all the unique words present in an html page. All you have to do is run:

```
./vocalive.py -o out_file.txt http://blog.example.com
```
It will create a file named "out_file.txt" in the same folder containing the unique words found in blog.example.com web page. You may specify the minimum length of words using the ```-m``` parameter. If you don't set that, the default length is 2 characters.
